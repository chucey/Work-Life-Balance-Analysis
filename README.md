# Work-Life-Balance-Analysis

This project required the students to perform a data analysis task on their preferred dataset as the final project. The lifestyle and wellbeing dataset from Kaggle was selected as our dataset. This dataset contained about 16,000 survey responses with 24 attributes that described the factors affecting how people live. The work-life balance survey assesses how each individual thrives in both their personal and professional life and as a result, how well your lifestyle and life habits are shaped in accordance to maximizing overall life satisfaction. This report outlines the work done by our group to comprehend, assess, and analyze the dataset. ![image](https://github.com/chucey/Work-Life-Balance-Analysis/assets/100479500/e0248556-e1da-4297-858e-8b79cde91c00)
